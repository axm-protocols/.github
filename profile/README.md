## Why Protocols?

AI agents are increasingly capable — but capability without governance is a liability. Today's agents produce great results, yet their work is hard to audit, reproduce, or certify. When the stakes are high — compliance, security, production code — you need more than "it usually works."

AXM takes a protocol-driven approach: **structured pipelines with validation gates, checkpointed state, and traceable artifacts**. Think air traffic control — not restricting what agents can do, but ensuring accountability at every step.

This philosophy shapes everything we build:

- **Constrained execution** — agents follow structured pipelines, validation gates prevent skipping steps
- **Two-stage validation** — fast structural checks first, semantic evaluation second
- **Session persistence** — execution state is saved and resumable after any interruption
- **Knowledge management** — URI-addressable, lazy-loaded resources for efficient context
- **Provenance tracking** — every artifact carries traceability metadata

## 🔧 Open-Source Tools

Production-grade Python tools — designed for humans and AI agents alike. Each tool is independent, structured-output-first, and MCP-compatible.

## ⚙️ Protocol Engine

Behind the open-source tools lies a **protocol execution engine** — the runtime that turns structured YAML protocols into validated, checkpointed agent workflows with server-enforced quality gates.

The engine is currently in private development. If you're interested in structured agent execution for your team, [reach out](mailto:gabriel@axm-protocols.io).

## Standards

All AXM repositories follow a shared gold standard enforced by `axm-init check`:

- `src/` layout, PEP 621, `py.typed`
- Ruff + MyPy (strict) + Pytest + Coverage
- GitHub Actions CI with trusted OIDC publishing
- MkDocs Material with Diátaxis documentation
- Pre-commit hooks, Dependabot, conventional commits
